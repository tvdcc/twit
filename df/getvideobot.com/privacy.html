               <h3>Types of Data Collected</h3>
               <p>Among the types of Personal Data that this Application collects, by itself or through third parties, there are:
                  Cookies, Usage Data, phone number, address, email address and city.
                  Complete details on each type of Personal Data collected are provided in the dedicated sections of this
                  privacy policy or by specific explanation texts displayed prior to the Data collection.
                  Personal Data may be freely provided by the User, or, in case of Usage Data, collected automatically when
                  using this Application.
               </p>
               <p>Unless specified otherwise, all Data requested by this Application is mandatory and failure to provide this
                  Data may make it impossible for this Application to provide its services. In cases where this Application
                  specifically states that some Data is not mandatory, Users are free not to communicate this Data without
                  consequences to the availability or the functioning of the Service.
               </p>
               <p>Users who are uncertain about which Personal Data is mandatory are welcome to contact the Owner.
                  Any use of Cookies &ndash; or of other tracking tools &ndash; by this Application or by the owners of third-party services
                  used by this Application serves the purpose of providing the Service required by the User, in addition to any
                  other purposes described in the present document and in the Cookie Policy, if available.
                  Users are responsible for any third-party Personal Data obtained, published or shared through this
                  Application and confirm that they have the third party's consent to provide the Data to the Owner.
               </p>
               <h3>Mode and Place of Processing the Data</h3>
               <h4>Methods of processing</h4>
               <p>The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or
                  unauthorized destruction of the Data.
               </p>
               <p>The Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT enabled tools, following organizational
                  procedures and modes strictly related to the purposes indicated. In addition to the Owner, in some cases,
                  the Data may be accessible to certain types of persons in charge, involved with the operation of this
                  Application (administration, sales, marketing, legal, system administration) or external parties (such as thirdparty technical service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies, communications agencies)
                  appointed, if necessary, as Data Processors by the Owner. The updated list of these parties may be
                  requested from the Owner at any time.
               </p>
               <h4>Legal basis of processing</h4>
               <p>The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following
                  applies:
               </p>
               <li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some legislations the
                  Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing (&ldquo;optout&rdquo;), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases. This, however, does
                  not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Data is subject to European data protection law;
               </li>
               <br>
               <li>provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any
                  pre-contractual obligations thereof;
               </li>
               <br>
               <li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;
                  processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official
                  authority vested in the Owner;
               </li>
               <br>
               <li>processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a
                  third party.
               </li>
               <p>In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and
                  in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a
                  requirement necessary to enter into a contract.
               </p>
               <p>
               <h4>Place</h4>
               <p> The Data is processed at the Owner's operating offices and in any other places where the parties
                  involved in the processing are located.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve transferring the User's Data to a country other
                  than their own. To find out more about the place of processing of such transferred Data, Users can check
                  the section containing details about the processing of Personal Data.
                  Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data transfers to a country outside the European
                  Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more
                  countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by the Owner to safeguard their Data.
                  If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking the relevant
               </p>
               <h4>Retention time</h4>
               <p>Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they
                  have been collected for.
               </p>
               <p>Therefore:
               <li>Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract between the Owner
                  and the User shall be retained until such contract has been fully performed.
               </li>
               <br>
               <li>Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner&rsquo;s legitimate interests shall be retained as long
                  as needed to fulfil such purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the legitimate
                  interests pursued by the Owner within the relevant sections of this document or by contacting the
                  Owner.
               </li>
               </p>
               <p>The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has given
                  consent to such processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be
                  obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to do so for the performance of a
                  legal obligation or upon order of an authority.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to
                  erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after expiration of the
                  retention period.
               </p>
               <h3>The Purposes of Processing</h3>
               <p>The Data concerning the User is collected to allow the Owner to provide its Services, as well as for the
                  following purposes: Content commenting, Interaction with external social networks and platforms and
                  Contacting the User.
               </p>

                  Personal Data used for each purpose in the respective sections of this document
               </p>
               <h3>DETAILED INFORMATION ON THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA</h3>
               <h4>Interaction with External Social Networks and Platforms</h4>
               <p>This type of service allows interaction with social networks or other external platforms directly from the pages
                  of this Application.
               </p>
               <p>The interaction and information obtained through this Application are always subject to the User&rsquo;s privacy
                  settings for each social network.
                  This type of service might still collect traffic data for the pages where the service is installed, even when

               </p>
               <h4>Twitter</h4>
               <p>This application may ask for some Twitter permissions allowing it to perform actions with the User&rsquo;s Twitter account and to retrieve information, including Personal Data, from it.
                  <br>The permissions asked are the following:
