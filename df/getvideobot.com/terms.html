                  By using GetVideoBot (the "Site"), you agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms of Use (the "GetVideoBot")
                  and/or any revised version. Any new service available on the Site or any modification of an existing
                  service will be governed by the TOS, which may be modified or updated from time to time. We strongly encourage you
                  to review the TOS regularly.

               <h3>Provided Service</h3>
               <p>
                  GetVideoBot makes it possible for its users to download videos and gifs
                  provided by third parties ("Third Party Content") through computer programs. GetVideoBot does not provide content but rather
                  makes it available to its users.
                  It is composed of computer code, which is the exclusive property of GetVideoBot.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Use of the Service is free of charge. However, access to more advanced features may be subject to a charge: this
                  billing is done outside of GetVideoBot. GetVideoBot does not host any Third Party Content and retains only
                  technical and personal data in accordance with our privacy policy.
               </p>
               <h3>Conduct</h3>

                  or hateful content or content that contains objects or symbols of hatred, invades the privacy of any third party or
                  is otherwise objectionable.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Respect the privacy of others and the confidentiality of information you may receive and not post, email or
                  otherwise transmit unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional material, spam, spam, chain letters,

                  as necessary to keep it true, complete, accurate and up-to-date.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Respect the rights of others and, more generally, all applicable laws and regulations relating to your use of the

                  that violates any confidentiality or fiduciary obligation you may have) that infringes the intellectual property
                  rights of any third party (including, but not limited to, copyrights, trademarks, trade-marks, trademarks, etc.).
                  Not to engage in conduct, display or share any content that interrupts, destroys, restricts or otherwise adversely
                  affects the Site and/or the Service or allows you to access the Site without permission, including by using viruses,
                  malicious computer codes, programs or files.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Not to reproduce, copy, sell or use commercially (including the right of access) in whole or in part, the Service
                  and/or the Site.
               </p>
               <p>
                  In the event of any violation of the foregoing, GetVideoBot reserves the right to block your access to the Site
                  and to disclose any information necessary to satisfy any law, regulation, governmental request or partner request,
                  in its sole discretion. GetVideoBot also reserves the right to block the distribution of Your Content or any Third
                  Party Content through the Service.
               </p>
               <h4>Important Information</h4>
               <p>
                  To access and use the Service, you must be legally able to enter into a binding agreement and acknowledge that
                  certain Third Party Content may be considered offensive by some and not suitable for persons under the age of 18.
                  You must also comply with all applicable laws and regulations in Canada and, if applicable, your country of origin.
               </p>
               <p>
                  You also acknowledge that the activity of creating, submitting or sharing Your Content may give rise to various
                  types of legal liability and you represent that Your Content (whether or not You are the author of such Content) is
                  at all times (whether or not You are the author of such Content) (both at the time of its initial submission and
                  throughout its access to the Site) compliant with the TOS and all applicable laws. You understand that GetVideoBot                  has no control (other than technical if necessary) and does not pre-select Your Third Party Content and cannot be
                  held responsible for their communication to the public.
               </p>
               <h3>Posting and Sharing Content</h3>
               <h4>Basic Principles</h4>
               <p>
                  You can publish and share Your Content by sending Third Party Content to a GetVideoBot. You acknowledge that you share
                  Your Content under your sole responsibility and declare that you own all rights or have obtained the necessary
                  permissions for such Content. You must verify that Your Content is compliant with the TOU and, more generally, that
                  it is not harmful or illegal.
                  You agree to comply with all GetVideoBot policies or technical requirements, to provide all data and information,
                  whether personal or otherwise, requested by GetVideoBot.
               </p>
               <p>
                  You understand that you cannot request any payment from GetVideoBot to view or share unfolded content.
               </p>
               <h4>Distribution of Your Content by GetVideoBot</h4>
               <p>
                  You expressly grant GetVideoBot the right, directly and indirectly, to distribute the content of Your Third-Party
                  Videos. GetVideoBot may distribute Your Content for commercial and non-commercial purposes without being liable for
                  any payment or compensation of any kind by GetVideoBot to you. GetVideoBot will, in its sole discretion, decide
                  whether or not (and how) it will distribute Your Content, choose its business partners, and determine all terms and
                  conditions of such distribution. If you do not agree with the above, you should not use GetVideoBot.
               </p>
               <h4>Identification of Your Content</h4>
               <p>
                  As we have no control over Your Content, it is your sole responsibility when posting Your Content on GetVideoBot                  to clearly and truly identify its actual or potential nature in order to ensure its classification into the
                  appropriate category. This is necessary for the proper functioning of the Service and to protect other users by
                  identifying content that may be explicit or pornographic.
               </p>
               <h3>Fees and Payment</h3>
               <p>If you opt for the PRO service, you will pay the fees for the Service subscription selected by you as published on the GetVideoBot website at the time that the term of this Agreement, or any renewal, begins.
                  You authorize GetVideoBot (either directly or through its third party payment processor) to charge the credit card identified by you (which you represent and warrant that you are authorized to use) for all applicable fees for your subscription in US dollars, including all applicable taxes.
                  If GetVideoBot does not receive payment from your credit card provider,  GetVideoBot will suspend your access to the PRO Service.
               </p>
               <h4>Refund Policy</h4>
               <p>Refund requests will be handled with no questions asked if service has not been used.
                  However, we will process other refund requests with due diligence.
               </p>
               <p>All refund requests must be made in writing to <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="573f323b3b3817303223213e3332383538237934383a">[email&#160;protected]</a> and we reserve the right to deny such request for any concrete reason.</p>
               <p>Our payment processor will make the reimbursement without undue delay, and not later than 14 days after the day on which your refund request was approved.</p>
               <h4>Canceling Your Subscription</h4>
               <p>Your GetVideoBot subscription will continue in effect unless and until you cancel your subscription by writing to use at <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="97fff2fbfbf8d7f0f2e3e1fef3f2f8f5f8e3b9f4f8fa">[email&#160;protected]</a>, or we terminate it.
                  You must cancel your subscription before it renews each month or year (depending on which account you select) in order to avoid billing of the next month’s/year’s fees to your credit card.
                  GetVideoBot will bill the monthly/yearly fees associated with your account plus any applicable tax to the credit card you provide to us during registration (or to a different credit card if you change your subscription information).
               </p>
               <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
               <h4>Limitation of Liability</h4>
